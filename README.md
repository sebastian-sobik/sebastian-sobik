## Short note about me ðŸ‘‹
<div style="width: 70ch;">
I have always felt a desire to create useful tools. This led me to my current position - the IT path. At the moment I am second year computer science student,    developing my passions through it.  
My spare time is filled with programming, always having in mind my goal - creating useful, intuitive programs which could improve and make life easier.
