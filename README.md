## Short note about me ðŸ‘‹
I have always felt a desire to create useful tools. This led me to my current position - the IT path. At the moment I am second year computer science student,    
developing my passions through it. My spare time is filled with programming, always having in mind my goal - creating useful, intuitive programs which could 
improve and make life easier. I am looking for my first experience in the IT industry to improve my skills in building applications, both architecturally and 
scripting.
